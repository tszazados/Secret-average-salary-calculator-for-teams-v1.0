# salaryAverageCalculator

Calculating the average of the entered numbers without keeping the concrete values in memory or even on the screen.
This program is safe. If it cannot hide the entered value a warning message will appear after starting it.

Perfect for calculating the average salary of a team.
Every team member have to enter their salary separately. 
After entering a value and hitting the Enter, the entered value will disappear from the screen.
Usable for 3 users or more.
When finished enter "exit" to make the calculation.

So, you will not tell your salary to the others but will get an average salary value of your team.
Cool, isn't it?

Source code is dirt simple on purpose for easy checking not to be tricked on.

Usage:
 Run from CLI (Cmd.exe) with the following command:
 
 php salary.php
 
( Note: php executable must be installed and reachable. )
