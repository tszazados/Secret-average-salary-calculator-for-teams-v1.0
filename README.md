# Secret-average-salary-calculator-for-teams-v1.0

This tiny and super simple program is calculating the average of the entered numbers without keeping the concrete values in memory or even on the screen. Perfect for calculating the average salary of a team without letting known each others' sallary. This program is safe to use, which means if it cannot hide the entered values a warning message will appear!

Every team member have to enter their salary separately. After entering a value and hitting the Enter, the entered value will disappear from the screen. Usable for 3 users or more. When finished please enter "exit" to make the calculation. You can press ^C as well to abort.
So once finsihed with the members, you did not tell your salary to the others but will know the average salary value of the team.

Cool, isn't it?
Source code is dirt simple on purpose for easy checking not to be tricked on.

Usage:
 Run from CLI (Cmd.exe) with the following command:
 
 php salary.php
 
( Note: php executable must be installed and reachable. )
